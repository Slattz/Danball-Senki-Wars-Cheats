# Danball Senki Wars Cheats

Cheats and Reverse Engineering for Danball Senki Wars 3DS (ダンボール戦機ウォーズ).

## Plugin ([Download](https://github.com/Slattz/Danball-Senki-Wars-Cheats/releases/latest))

* This repo contains an open-source cheats plugin Danball Senki Wars, built using [CTRPluginFramework](https://github.com/Nanquitas/CTRPluginFramework-BlankTemplate) by Nanquitas.
* Requires [Luma 3GXv2 Loader](https://github.com/Nanquitas/Luma3DS/tree/3gx-loader) ([Download Build](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479233979271086090/742873831533838518/boot.firm))
* These cheats collectively use a mixture of patching the game's code, redirecting the game's code to our own custom ARM assembly code, and writing code that interacts with the save file.

### Features

* Shop Is Free (Price of everything is 0)
* All Items
* General EXP Multiplier
* Friendship EXP Multiplier

## Save Structure

* A majority of Danball Senki Wars's savefile structure was reverse engineered while making the plugin. 
* It was put into a 010 Editor Template for easy use, and can be found [here](https://github.com/Slattz/Danball-Senki-Wars-Cheats/blob/master/Reverse_Engineering/DSW_savefile.bt).
